# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Analysis (SQL Views)

A SQL-based data exploration project analyzing hospital readmission patterns, patient risk categories, and resource utilization. The project creates reusable views for key healthcare analytics metrics.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Average Time in Hospital**: Calculates the mean length of stay across all patients  
- 👥 **Readmission by Age**: Breaks down readmission counts and trends across different age groups  
- 🩺 **Common Diagnoses**: Identifies the top 10 primary diagnoses at admission  
- 💉 **Diabetes Readmissions**: Examines the relationship between diabetes medication and readmission rates  
- 📈 **Readmission Rates by Diagnosis**: Calculates readmission percentages for each primary diagnosis  
- 🏥 **Resource Utilization**: Analyzes the average number of procedures, lab tests, and medications per patient  
- 🚨 **Patient Risk Stratification**: Labels patients as `High Risk` or `Low Risk` based on procedures, emergency visits, and hospital stay length  
- 📆 **Age-Based Readmission Rates**: Provides age-stratified readmission percentages  

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **SQL** (Tested on PostgreSQL / MySQL-compatible syntax)
- Hospital readmission dataset (custom / Kaggle-compatible)
